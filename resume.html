<h4>Junior Engineer</h4>
</div>
<div class="roledesc small" id="roledesc-da">
<p>
As the soul engineer for SeenON.com, a site with 3.5 million pageviews a month, 
I was responsible for everything from
requirements gathering to release management.
</p>
<ul class="elegant">
<li>
I architected robust and flexible modules based off of requirements
gathered from our marketing team.
I brought our release process more in line with industry standards 
by making sure we always knew which version of the site was in production.
</li>
<li>
I saw the site through a complete redesign, as well as a major version upgrade to the Zend Framework.
I also merged the entire company from Movable Type to multi-user Wordpress. 
</li>
<li>
I switched our site from a self-hosted ad-server to a hosted solution,
making sure it was easy for the production team to configure ads fully, 
and to accuratly report on them.
</li>
<li>
I moved the operations team to Trac for ticketing so that requests and bugs weren't lost
through other forms of communcation, and to better enforce accountability.
</li>
<li>
I wrote numerous integrations with our CMS backend using RSS as a data layer. 
I also created a flexible product recommendation module, which allows an editor to 
force results on a per-item basis configurable through the CMS, or to restrict results
to a certain arbitrary category.
</li>
